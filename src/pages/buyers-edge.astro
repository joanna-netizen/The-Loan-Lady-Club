            Most lenders hand you a pre-approval letter based on a quick review and send you out to shop. Real underwriting happens later, after you have already made offers, paid inspection fees, put down a deposit, and gotten emotionally attached to a home.

          <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed opacity-80">
            That is a terrible time to find out there is a problem with your file. By then you have already spent money you cannot get back, and sometimes you lose the home entirely.

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
          Think about it this way. If you wanted to buy a great pair of Nike shoes and you walked into Famous Footwear, they might have four or five models to choose from. That does not mean other Nike shoes do not exist. It just means you are shopping in the wrong place.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
          Banks work the same way. They can only offer you their own products. That does not mean better options do not exist. It means you are fishing in the wrong pond.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed opacity-80">
          As your mortgage broker, I have access to over 100 wholesale lenders. That is the whole Nike factory. I shop every one of them to find you the most competitive rate and the right product for your situation, not just whatever my employer happens to sell.
