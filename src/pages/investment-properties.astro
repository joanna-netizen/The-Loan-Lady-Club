  <!-- What Is a DSCR Loan -->

        <h2 class="font-heading text-4xl text-charcoal mb-4">What Is a DSCR Loan?</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-12 items-center">
        <div>
          <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
            DSCR stands for Debt Service Coverage Ratio. It is a measure of whether the property generates enough rental income to cover its own mortgage payment.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
            A DSCR of 1.0 means the property's rent exactly covers the payment. A DSCR above 1.0 means it generates more income than it costs. Most lenders want to see a DSCR of 1.0 or higher, though some programs allow below 1.0 depending on the borrower's profile.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed opacity-80">
            The key advantage: your personal income, employment history, and tax returns are not part of the equation. This makes DSCR loans the preferred tool for investors who are self-employed, have complex financials, or simply do not want to run their personal income through underwriting every time they acquire a property.

        <h2 class="font-heading text-3xl text-charcoal mb-6">Investment Properties Are a Different Game</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
          When you are buying a primary residence, you can put as little as 3 to 3.5 percent down. When you are buying an investment property, the rules change. The bank needs to believe you are actually going to live somewhere else. If you already own a home and you want to buy a rental property, the bank is going to look at that as an investment, and you will need to put more down, typically 15 to 20 percent.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed opacity-80">
          That is not a bad thing. It is just how investment property financing works, and understanding it up front means you plan correctly and do not get surprised at the end of the process.

                One of the most underused strategies for new investors. If you buy a 2 to 4 unit property and occupy one of the units as your primary residence, you may qualify for owner-occupied financing including FHA with as little as 3.5 percent down. You live in one unit and rent the others. The rental income can offset or even cover your mortgage payment entirely while you build equity and ride appreciation.

      <h2 class="font-heading text-4xl text-charcoal mb-8">How Real Estate Builds Generational Wealth</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
        You buy a property, put a tenant in, and make sure it is covering the mortgage payment. You ride the appreciation, take the tax write-off, and start building passive income. Over the years, you owe considerably less on the property while its value has grown.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
        In your lifetime you can pay it off entirely and leave a revenue-generating property to your family. They can occupy it and never worry about housing costs, or they can collect the passive income. That is how generational wealth actually works.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed opacity-80">
        It starts with one property and the right financing structure from the beginning.

        <div class="bg-warm-cream p-8 rounded-md">
          <h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-charcoal mb-3">Do I need to be an experienced investor to get a DSCR loan?</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
            No. DSCR loans are available to first-time investors as well as experienced portfolio builders. What matters most is the property's income potential and your credit profile. We will review your full situation and identify which programs fit.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-warm-cream p-8 rounded-md">
          <h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-charcoal mb-3">How is the rental income calculated for DSCR?</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
            Lenders typically use an appraisal with a rent schedule to determine the market rent for the property. For properties with an existing lease, the actual lease may be used. I will walk you through how your specific property will be evaluated before you commit to anything.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-warm-cream p-8 rounded-md">
          <h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-charcoal mb-3">Can I use a DSCR loan to refinance an existing investment property?</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
            Yes. DSCR loans work for both purchase and refinance of investment properties. If you have equity in an existing rental and want to pull cash out for your next acquisition, a DSCR cash-out refinance is one way to do it without going through full income documentation.
          </p>

        <div class="bg-warm-cream p-8 rounded-md">
          <h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-charcoal mb-3">What credit score do I need?</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
            Most DSCR programs require a minimum score in the 620 to 680 range, with better pricing available at higher scores. I will pull your numbers and show you exactly where you land across the programs that are available to you.
