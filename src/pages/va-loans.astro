        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal opacity-70 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          No other loan program combines these benefits in one package. If you are eligible, the VA loan is almost always worth looking at first.

          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70 text-sm">
            Conventional loans with less than 20 percent down require PMI, which adds to your monthly payment. VA loans have no PMI requirement. That savings adds up significantly over time.

          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70 text-sm">
            VA loans typically carry rates at or below conventional loan rates because the government backing reduces lender risk. I shop over 100 wholesale lenders to find you the most competitive rate available.

            VA loans have more flexible credit requirements than conventional loans. There is no official VA minimum credit score, though individual lenders set their own guidelines. I work with lenders across the spectrum to find the right fit.

  <!-- The Funding Fee -->

        <h2 class="font-heading text-3xl text-charcoal mb-6">The One Cost to Understand: The VA Funding Fee</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
          The VA loan does not have PMI, but it does have a one-time funding fee. This fee goes to the VA to keep the program running for future generations of veterans. It ranges from roughly 1.25 to 3.3 percent of the loan amount depending on your down payment, loan type, and whether it is your first time using the benefit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
          The good news is that the funding fee can be rolled into your loan amount, so it does not have to come out of your pocket at closing. And some veterans are exempt entirely, including those receiving VA disability compensation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed opacity-80">
          I will show you exactly what the funding fee looks like for your specific situation in your Itemized Fee Worksheet so you can compare the true cost against other loan options side by side.

      <div class="space-y-6">

        <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-md">
          <h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-charcoal mb-3">Can I use a VA loan more than once?</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
            Yes. VA entitlement can be restored after a previous VA loan is paid off or the property is sold. In some cases you may even be able to have two VA loans at once depending on your remaining entitlement and loan amounts. We will review your entitlement status as part of your consultation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-md">
          <h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-charcoal mb-3">Do I have to put zero down, or can I put money down if I want to?</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
            You can put money down if you choose. Putting down 5 percent or 10 percent reduces your funding fee and your monthly payment. I will show you both scenarios so you can decide what makes the most sense for your financial picture.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-md">
          <h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-charcoal mb-3">Is the VA loan always the best option for veterans?</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
            Usually yes, but not always. For veterans with strong credit and a solid down payment saved, conventional can sometimes be competitive depending on the funding fee and loan amount. My job is to run both scenarios side by side and show you the actual numbers. You make the decision with full information.

          <h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-charcoal mb-3">What is a Certificate of Eligibility and do I need it before we start?</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
            A Certificate of Eligibility confirms your VA entitlement to lenders. You do not need it in hand before our first conversation. I can help you obtain it as part of the process. Many COEs can be pulled electronically in minutes.
