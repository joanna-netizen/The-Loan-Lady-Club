            I have spent 15+ years learning every corner of the mortgage industry so that you don't have to figure it out alone. My job is not to sell you a loan. My job is to educate you, show you all of the products and programs you're eligible for, how each works, and let YOU decide what works best for your family.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I started from the ground up, worked through every role in lending, helped buyers and homeowners navigate each changing market, and built a business entirely on referrals. No marketing spend. No cold calls. Just clients who trust me enough to send their family and friends.

      <p class="text-xl text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-80">
        Most mortgage brokers quote you a rate and collect an application. That is not what I do.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed opacity-70 mb-6">
        I completely pre-underwrite your loan file BEFORE you start shopping for homes. That means when you make an offer, we have already done the hard work. No surprises at the end. No deals falling apart. No wasted inspection fees.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed opacity-70">
        I also educate you on every product you qualify for, side by side, line by line, so you can make an informed decision. You choose what is best for your family. Not what is easiest for me to sell.

            <p class="text-charcoal opacity-70">
              Started with a finance degree that gave me the theoretical foundation. Then immediately went into consumer loan sales to learn the human side of lending, seeing firsthand how money affects people's lives. I also worked in credit underwriting, closing, and notary services from day one.

              Recruited as a mortgage banker and worked with multiple branches nationwide. Mastered FHA, VA, conventional, and investor loans at scale. Learned everything a large banking institution could teach me, and also learned its limitations.

              Moved to a smaller retail company specifically to access broader product offerings beyond what big banks could offer. Learned wholesale lending, expanded underwriting, and discovered that clients were being underserved by institutions that could only offer their own products.

              Founded The Loan Lady Club to bring together everything I had learned into one place. Best interest rates, lowest fees, and the exceptional service everyone else overlooked. I help with all loan types for residential financing for 1-4 unit properties, and I built this business entirely on referrals. No marketing spend. No cold calls. Just results that clients trust enough to share with the people they love.

            I lead with your circumstances and the numbers, not a scripted pitch. If you have a great low rate and want equity, I will pivot to a HELOC so you keep that rate. If a refinance does not create a clear win, I will say just that. And if one credit fix earns you a much better conventional path, I would rather help you prepare than rush you into a “buy now” loan. My job is to give you clear education and thoughtful guidance, so you feel confident choosing what will serve you for years to come.
